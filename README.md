## Overview

Abacus is a zero-dependency cross-precision 3D maths library for .NET, Mono and .NET Core, built with a primary focus on performance and efficiency.  Abacus is ideal for use developing real-time 3D applications and deterministic network simulations.  

Documentation for Abacus can be found [here][docs].

## Why?

Microsoft's [XNA][xna] was a popular framework for building games and 3D applications using C#; part of the framework consisted of an excellent maths library for use with floating point numbers.

On a number of occasions I found myself wanting to use XNA's maths library in C# projects of my own, yet I didn't want to be tied to the prerequisites imposed by XNA.  I also wanted the ability to use the same set of functionality with with differing levels of precision, i.e. a library that would expose the same API for working with 32-bit floating point numbers as it did for working with 64-bit floating point numbers and even 64-bit fixed point numbers.

Abacus aims to provide all of the features of the XNA maths library whilst also supporting multiple levels of precision.

## Getting started

Abacus is available as a stand-alone library via [nuget][nuget].  Here's an example nuget `packages.config` file that pulls in Abacus:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<packages>
  <package id="Abacus" version="0.9.2"/>
</packages>
```

Alternatively, as all code associated with each of Abacus' supported levels of precision gets generated into a single C# source file, it is easy to simply copy the appropriate [Abacus.XYZ.cs][sources] file for the precision you need straight into your project.

## So, what types are actually supported?

Abacus provides implementations of the following data types:

* `Vector2`
* `Vector3`
* `Vector4`
* `Matrix44`
* `Quaternion`

consistently across the following precisions:

* `Single` (`float`)
* `Double` (`double`)
* `Fixed32` (proof of concept)


## Status

Is Abacus ready to be used?  Yes indeed.

Abacus currently runs 638 unit tests with each build and has complete test coverage over both 32-bit and 64-bit floating point precision (`float` and `double`).

One goal of the project is for Abacus to consistently support mathematical operations and data types for more than just `float` and `double` precision numbers.  Abacus is being built to provide it's own implementations for various fixed point number formats and additional floating point number formats:

* `Fixed32`
* `Fixed64`
* `Fixed128`
* `Half`
* `Quadruple`

Currently full support for these types with full unit test coverage is the next step on the roadmap.

At this stage a working  `Fixed32` type is provided as a proof of concept, however, the unit tests associated with the type are currently disabled as in their present form they do not .


## Example usage

```cs
/**
 * Choose which level of precision to use simply by
 * commenting out all but the appropriate 'using'
 * statement:
 */

// using Abacus.SinglePrecision;
using Abacus.DoublePrecision;
// using Abacus.Fixed32Precision;

class Program
{
    public static void Main (string[] args)
    {
        var a = new Vector2 (-100, +50);
        var b = new Vector2 (+90, -70);

        var c = new Vector2 (-20, +5);
        var d = new Vector2 (+30, -5);
        
        Vector2 result;
        double amount = 0.4;
        
        Vector2.CatmullRom (ref a, ref b, ref c, ref d, ref amount, out result);
        
        System.Console.WriteLine ("result: " + result);
    }
}

```


## Roadmap

## Technical Details

Authoring a consistent API for Abacus across multiple levels of precision presents techinical challenge because the C# language has limited support for experessing constraints for generics; for this reason Abacus has been built using a templatization mechanism to ensure a consitent API across precisions, this can be a little cumbersome to work with from an author's perspective, however, as a user it works well and brings the added benefit that the entire libary is generated into a small set of files (one for each level of precision), making Abacus easy to embed into any C#Â project.
